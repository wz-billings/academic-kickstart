Zane Billings is extremely excited to begin his graduate education at the University of Georgia in the fall! He will begin his PhD program in biostatistics very soon.

Soon, this information will be outdated: Zane Billings is a mathematics student pursuing his undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and molecular biology at Western Carolina University. He has experience in R programming, scientific computing, differential equation models, and data analysis. 

Zane has participated in two REU programs, [Math-Biology at UNCG](http://www.uncg.edu/mat/bio-math/REU/people.html) and [Population Biology of Infectious Diseases at UGA](http://reu.ecology.uga.edu/). Additionally, Zane was the TA for a course on scientific computing for three semesters at WCU. His previous work, employment, etc. can be accessed through the projects and links pages here, or through the outgoing links to the left.
