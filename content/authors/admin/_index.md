Zane Billings is a first-year PhD student in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics program at the University of Georgia. He has experience in R programming, scientific computing, differential equation models, and data analysis. He obtained his undergraduate degree in mathematics and biology at Western Carolina University, where his research primarily focused on keratin based modulation of the autophagy pathway.

Zane has participated in two REU programs, [Math-Biology at UNCG](http://www.uncg.edu/mat/bio-math/REU/people.html) and [Population Biology of Infectious Diseases at UGA](http://reu.ecology.uga.edu/). Additionally, Zane was the TA for a course on scientific computing for three semesters at WCU. His previous work, employment, etc. can be accessed through the projects and links pages here, or through the outgoing links to the left.
