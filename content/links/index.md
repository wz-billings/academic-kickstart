* I also keep my {{% staticref "files/ascii.txt" %}} CV in ASCII form {{% /staticref %}} in case a machine needs to read it (or a person who doesn't like PDFs or proprietary formatting, or something). 

* You can [search me on the OEIS](https://oeis.org/search?q=W.+Zane+Billings&language=english&go=Search). Currently I have contributed two sequences and provided Python code for a third sequence. Integer sequences are fun so I am hoping to find some more.

* Here is a {{% staticref "files/courses.pdf" %}}list of all of the courses{{% /staticref %}} I have taken and their descriptions. (List does not include liberal studies.)

* And, just in case that wasn't enough, a copy of my {{% staticref "files/transcript.pdf" %}}unofficial transcript{{% /staticref %}}.
